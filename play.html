<h3>ACT II.  _The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_.</h3>
<p>
    _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.
                               _Door_ R.C.
                               
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?

    MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
    to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.
    
    LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
    escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
    power and use it.
    
    LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
    all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
    place.
    
    MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?
    
    LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.
    
    MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
    not married?
    
    LADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a
    wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
    about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
    within twelve months.
    
    LADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some
    one who, perhaps, is tied to another?
    
    LADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
    in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
    meddle with other people’s property.
    
    MRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
    people’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the
    only true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we
    don’t belong to any one.
    
    LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.
    
    LADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
    legislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,
    all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like
    married men.</p>
