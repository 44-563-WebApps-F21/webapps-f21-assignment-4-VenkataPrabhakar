<h3>ACT II.  _The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_.</h3>

<p class ="stage-direction">[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>
    <p class="speech"><h4 class ="name ladystuffield fas fa-user h5">LADY STUTFIELD.</h4>  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
        escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
        power and use it.</p>
    
    <p class="speech"><h4 class ="name Caroline fas fa-user h5">LADY CAROLINE.</h4> <br><h4 class ="stage-direction"> [_Takes coffee from Servant_.] </h4><br> What stuff and nonsense
        all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
        place.</p>
    
    <p class="speech"><h4 class ="name allonby fas fa-user h5">MRS. ALLONBY.</h4>  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?</p>
    <p><h4>LADY CAROLINE.</h4>  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.</p>
    
   
    <p class="speech"><h4 class ="name allonby fas fa-user h5">MRS. ALLONBY.</h4> <br><h4 class ="stage-direction"> [_Takes coffee from Servant_.] </h4>  Really?  And if they’re
        not married?</p>
   <p><h4 class ="name  Caroline fas fa-user h5">LADY CAROLINE.</h4>  If they are not married, they should be looking after a
    wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
    about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
    within twelve months.</p>
    
    <p class="speech"><h4 class ="name ladystuffield fas fa-user h5">LADY STUTFIELD.</h4> <br> <h4 class ="stage-direction">[_Refuses coffee_.]</h4><br>  But if they’re in love with some
        one who, perhaps, is tied to another?</p>
    
    <p class="speech"><h4 class ="name  Caroline fas fa-user h5">LADY CAROLINE. </h4> In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
        in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
        meddle with other people’s property.</p>
